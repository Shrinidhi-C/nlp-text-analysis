Can you tell me if there is a backlog or waiting list of applicants in each field and whether any preference is given to earlier applicants?

The thought of my Kia having a new life as an educational tool thrills me. It is a 2006 Kia Sorrento 5-speed 4x4 with new tires and a full tank of gas. The #3 cylinder does not fire well. Tune up is $800 due to 5 hours labor removing stuff to get to the plugs. The clutch does not work at all. It never slipped, just went out while driving. I still drive it.
